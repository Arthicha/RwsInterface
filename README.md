# RobVisProject-
SDU's RobVis Project

## Example Code
Here, we have provided four example programs.
1. EX1_PICK_AND_PASTE for a simple pick and place operation with sparse stereo pose estimation
2. EX2_REACHABILITY_ANALYSIS for performing analysis of the mounting location of the robot
3. EX3_RRT_MOTION_PLANNING for studying different type of RRT-based motion planning
4. EX4_SPARSE_STEREO for studying the performance of sparse stereo pose estimation

## Available Interface
- Image interface
- Forward kinematics (FK)
- Inverse kinematics (IK)
- Simulation (move the robot based on FK and IK)
- Moving robot and object
- Sparse Sterio
- Disparity Map
- Grasping
- RRT path planning
